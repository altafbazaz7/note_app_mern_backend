############################### MERN STACK BLOG APP ###########################

I have made this app using React/Node/Express/MongoDB

For styling i have used Material UI.

I have used Axios for API calls , react-router-dom v6 fro navigating among pages on the front end.

Workflow of App:

=> User gets to homescreen and is able to see all blogs in database.

=> User clicks on add icon to create another Blog 

=> User enters title and description {user can here boldify, italify , underline etc.} his text.

=> User clicks on save and is navigated to homepage

=> User can click on any blog post to see its all details.

=> All the API calls from front end can be found in Services directory.

=> All the styling and themeing can be found in Components directory.

=> Out of CRUD operations , < create > < read all > < read one > functionalities have been implemented.
